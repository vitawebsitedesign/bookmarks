The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) displays company investor information.
There was a period of time when their website was outdated & simply didn't display market capitalization for businesses.
A website that can quickly fetch market capitalizations by company ticker would be productive & valuable.
This website allows users to productively fetch market capitalizations, & is made possible by direct access to the ASX API.
