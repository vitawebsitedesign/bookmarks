The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) displays company investor information.
A long time ago, their website became very outdated.
For some reason, there wasn't an easy & quick way to view business market capitalisation amounts.
A website that can quickly fetch market capitalisations by company ticker through the ASX API, would be productive & valuable.
