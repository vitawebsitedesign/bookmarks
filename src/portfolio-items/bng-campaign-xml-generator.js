BallisticNG is a Steam product that enables consumers to integrate using hand-written XML files.
Hand writing XML filess is error prone & unproductive.
Hence, a tool with a user-friendly UI to automatically generate their necessary XML is quite valuable.
For maximal access, this tool is hosted as a simple CodePen, which was made possible through Webpack.
