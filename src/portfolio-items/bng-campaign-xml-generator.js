    "overview": `
BNG is a Steam product that enables consumers to integrate their hand-written XML files.
Hand writing XML files (especially outside of an IDE) is error prone & unproductive.
Hence, a tool with a user-friendly UI to automatically generate the necessary XML would be quite valuable.
For maximal access, this tool is hosted on CodePen, which was made possible through Webpack bundles.
