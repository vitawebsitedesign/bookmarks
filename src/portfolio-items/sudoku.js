Well-formed Sudoku puzzles have a solution that can be determined via algorithms.
This project explores the application of depth-first tree searching (in combination with back-stepping) to brute-force sudoku puzzles.
Due to the space complexity, this product prioritises memory efficiency during solution generation.
