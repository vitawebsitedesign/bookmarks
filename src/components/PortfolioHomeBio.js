                Michael is a Sydney Software Engineer with an unhealthy programming obsession.
            </p>
            <p>
                Schedule overrun is a prominent issue in the software project world. This has driven a strong passion in reading software project risk management books such as <i>“Rapid Development”</i> &amp; <i>“The Pragmatic Programmer”</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe a business wants software delivered yesterday. Maybe there's project risks and/or unknown-unknowns. Maybe customers change their requirements after seeing prototypes. Over time, Michael has holistically observed software deliveries across a broad range of outcomes, which has resulted in a humble, strong &amp; risk-oriented work ethic that propels an attitude to be better than yesterday, everyday.
